# #SlowMapChallenge begins October 25!

What is it? 

- Pick **just one map idea** that's been nagging you. Try to focus on this. Something you can enjoy üòç or gift üéÅ .
- Try to spend at least **1 hour** per week on the map. ‚è≤ You can spend more if you want, or less!
- Every **Sunday** share a screenshot of your progress and tag **#SlowMapChallenge** (even if you didn't do much...that's allowed üòå )
- At 2pm East coast time, jump into **#community-creativecarto** chat on the NACIS slack to chat with folks about your project. (optional)
- Support one another, giving technical tips, feedback (when requested), and encouragement. ü§ó
- Give yourself grace if you skip a week or need a break.
- At the end of twelve weeks (**January 16, 2022**), print your map, hang it up, and drink a warm drink.


## But why?

As always, leaving NACIS I have an overwhelming, borderline pathological amount of creative inspiration. There were so many amazing presentations and discussions. So many things that I want to experiment and iterate on. So many new peers I‚Äôd love to work with and follow. 

But then there‚Äôs the din of life‚Äôs responsibilities, work, and the ever strengthening attention economy aiming to transfix us. 

Inspired by [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge#code-of-conduct), the [#SlowMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/DanielPWWood/status/1449027705501061164) will be a 12 week journey towards creating a map that you are excited about. We will aim to carve out just a little time (as a snack) each week to make sustained improvements to our projects. We will support each other and give help and feedback through slack and twitter. At the end of 12 weeks, we will have a something to print, and enjoy. And if you want, you'll have the opportunity to submit your design to the [Atlas of Design](https://atlasofdesign.org/submit/) for their deadline of Jan. 17, 2022.


## But what should I map?

Whatever you want! If you don't have an idea of what to do and need a prompt, here are some ideas you can iterate on for free.

- Make a map of your hometown or current neighborhood using a new technique (this is what I was going to do, but changed my mind)
- Make a map of where your parents or ancestors came from in an old style (this is what I'm going to do).
- Make an updated/modern version of the Lord Of The Rings map, complete with topography and updated geography (this is something I want to do some day)
- Pick a random place with gorgeous elevation and just hone your DEM/blender/hillshade skills. Maybe oblique?

## But I have questions and comments

Well [my DM's](https://twitter.com/DanielPWWood) are open. 


## Code of Conduct

Admittedly, this is pilfered from [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge#code-of-conduct), but here goes:

- Everyone is welcome to participate regardless of skill-level. 
- All maps must be original work.
- Give credit for data and ideas where possible.
- Don't be a meany. Haters and trolls BACK OFF.

## Thanks
Special thanks to [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov), creator of #30DayMapChallenge for the inspiration to do something like this, just slower. Thanks also to the folks at [#creativecarto](https://creativecarto.github.io/) for showing what's possible and providing some backbone to the community aspect of this.
