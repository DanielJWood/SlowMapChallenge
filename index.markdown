As always, leaving NACIS I have an overwhelming, borderline pathological amount of creative inspiration. There were so many amazing presentations and discussions. So many things that I want to experiment and iterate on. So many new peers I’d love to work with and follow. 

But then there’s the din of life’s responsibilities, work, and the ever strengthening attention economy aiming to transfix us. 

Inspired by #30DayMapChallenge, the #SlowMapChallenge will be a TKTK week journey towards creating a map that you are excited to hang on your wall or give to a loved one (or both!). We will aim to carve out just a little time (as a snack) each week to make sustained improvements to our projects. We will support each other and give help and feedback through slack and twitter.

Here are the rules

# A manifesto of creative cooperation and attention rebellion

Your attention and time are your most precious resources. Distraction and noise are everywhere in our lives. Some of it is very good. Lots of it is not. This cooperative challenge is a way for us to wrest some of that attention back towards things that we want to focus on, not the things that are being mainlined into our eyeballs by the attention economy. 

And after several weeks of working on this, we will have a tangible creation to enjoy, to give, to share. And then we can take some time away from creating and rest. And then we can do it again as the muses dictate :)

# Code of Conduct

Admittedly, this is pilfered from #30DayMapChallenge, but here goes.
